# ES-Project
Created a battery-powered LED lamp with an Arduino UNO, controlled by a TV remote. It featured 4 white LEDs and 1 multi-color LED, with functions for sequential lighting, color cycling, and dimming. The project involved circuit design and programming, improving my skills in microcontroller use and electronics.
